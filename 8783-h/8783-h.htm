<h2>CANTO IX</h2>
<br>

<p>THE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks<br>
Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,<br>
Chas'd that from his which newly they had worn,<br>
And inwardly restrain'd it. &nbsp;He, as one<br>
Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye<br>
Not far could lead him through the sable air,<br>
And the thick-gath'ring cloud. &nbsp;"It yet behooves<br>
We win this fight"&mdash;thus he began&mdash;"if not&mdash;<br>
Such aid to us is offer'd.&mdash;Oh, how long<br>
Me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!"<br>
<br>I noted, how the sequel of his words<br>
Clok'd their beginning; for the last he spake<br>
Agreed not with the first. &nbsp;But not the less<br>
My fear was at his saying; sith I drew<br>
To import worse perchance, than that he held,<br>
His mutilated speech. &nbsp;"Doth ever any<br>
Into this rueful concave's extreme depth<br>
Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain<br>
Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?"<br>
<br>Thus I inquiring. "Rarely," he replied,<br>
"It chances, that among us any makes<br>
This journey, which I wend. &nbsp;Erewhile 'tis true<br>
Once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell<br>
Erictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades<br>
Back to their bodies. &nbsp;No long space my flesh<br>
Was naked of me, when within these walls<br>
She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit<br>
From out of Judas' circle. &nbsp;Lowest place<br>
Is that of all, obscurest, and remov'd<br>
Farthest from heav'n's all-circling orb. &nbsp;The road<br>
Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.<br>
That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round<br>
The city' of grief encompasses, which now<br>
We may not enter without rage." &nbsp;Yet more<br>
He added: but I hold it not in mind,<br>
For that mine eye toward the lofty tower<br>
Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top.<br>
Where in an instant I beheld uprisen<br>
At once three hellish furies stain'd with blood:<br>
In limb and motion feminine they seem'd;<br>
Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd<br>
Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept<br>
Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.<br>
<br>He knowing well the miserable hags<br>
Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-097.jpg"><img alt="09-097b.jpg (45K)" src="images/09-097b.jpg" height="532" width="349"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left<br>
This is Megaera; on the right hand she,<br>
Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone<br>
I' th' midst." &nbsp;This said, in silence he remain'd<br>
Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves<br>
Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd,<br>
That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.<br>
"Hasten Medusa: so to adamant<br>
Him shall we change;" all looking down exclaim'd.<br>
"E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took<br>
No ill revenge." &nbsp;"Turn thyself round, and keep<br>
Thy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire<br>
Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return<br>
Upwards would be for ever lost." &nbsp;This said,<br>
Himself my gentle master turn'd me round,<br>
Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own<br>
He also hid me. &nbsp;Ye of intellect<br>
Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd<br>
Under close texture of the mystic strain!<br>
<br>And now there came o'er the perturbed waves<br>
Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made<br>
Either shore tremble, as if of a wind<br>
Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,<br>
That 'gainst some forest driving all its might,<br>
Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls<br>
Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps<br>
Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.<br>
<br>Mine eyes he loos'd, and spake: "And now direct<br>
Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,<br>
There, thickest where the smoke ascends." As frogs<br>
Before their foe the serpent, through the wave<br>
Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one<br>
Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits<br>
Destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one<br>
Who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound.<br>
He, from his face removing the gross air,<br>
Oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone<br>
By that annoyance wearied. &nbsp;I perceiv'd<br>
That he was sent from heav'n, and to my guide<br>
Turn'd me, who signal made that I should stand<br>
Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full<br>
Of noble anger seem'd he!  To the gate<br>
He came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat<br>
Open without impediment it flew.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-101.jpg"><img alt="09-101b.jpg (52K)" src="images/09-101b.jpg" height="408" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>"Outcasts of heav'n!  O abject race and scorn'd!"<br>
Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,<br>
"Whence doth this wild excess of insolence<br>
Lodge in you? wherefore kick you 'gainst that will<br>
Ne'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft<br>
Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?<br>
What profits at the fays to but the horn?<br>
Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence<br>
Bears still, peel'd of their hair, his throat and maw."<br>
<br>This said, he turn'd back o'er the filthy way,<br>
And syllable to us spake none, but wore<br>
The semblance of a man by other care<br>
Beset, and keenly press'd, than thought of him<br>
Who in his presence stands. &nbsp;Then we our steps<br>
Toward that territory mov'd, secure<br>
After the hallow'd words. &nbsp;We unoppos'd<br>
There enter'd; and my mind eager to learn<br>
What state a fortress like to that might hold,<br>
I soon as enter'd throw mine eye around,<br>
And see on every part wide-stretching space<br>
Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.<br>
<br>As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,<br>
Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro's gulf,<br>
That closes Italy and laves her bounds,<br>
The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;<br>
So was it here, save what in horror here<br>
Excell'd: for 'midst the graves were scattered flames,<br>
Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn'd,<br>
That iron for no craft there hotter needs.<br>
<br>Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath<br>
From them forth issu'd lamentable moans,<br>
Such as the sad and tortur'd well might raise.<br>
<br>I thus: "Master! say who are these, interr'd<br>
Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear<br>
The dolorous sighs?" &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-105.jpg"><img alt="09-105b.jpg (43K)" src="images/09-105b.jpg" height="551" width="360"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>"The arch-heretics are here, accompanied<br>
By every sect their followers; and much more,<br>
Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like<br>
With like is buried; and the monuments<br>
Are different in degrees of heat." &nbsp;This said,<br>
He to the right hand turning, on we pass'd<br>
Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.</p>

<h2>CANTO X</h2>
<br>

<p>NOW by a secret pathway we proceed,<br>
Between the walls, that hem the region round,<br>
And the tormented souls: my master first,<br>
I close behind his steps. &nbsp;"Virtue supreme!"<br>
I thus began; "who through these ample orbs<br>
In circuit lead'st me, even as thou will'st,<br>
Speak thou, and satisfy my wish. &nbsp;May those,<br>
Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?<br>
Already all the lids are rais'd, and none<br>
O'er them keeps watch." &nbsp;He thus in answer spake<br>
"They shall be closed all, what-time they here<br>
From Josaphat return'd shall come, and bring<br>
Their bodies, which above they now have left.<br>
The cemetery on this part obtain<br>
With Epicurus all his followers,<br>
Who with the body make the spirit die.<br>
Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon<br>
Both to the question ask'd, and to the wish,<br>
Which thou conceal'st in silence." &nbsp;I replied:<br>
"I keep not, guide belov'd! from thee my heart<br>
Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,<br>
A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself."<br>
<br>"O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire<br>
Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!<br>
Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance<br>
Declares the place of thy nativity<br>
To be that noble land, with which perchance<br>
I too severely dealt." &nbsp;Sudden that sound<br>
Forth issu'd from a vault, whereat in fear<br>
I somewhat closer to my leader's side<br>
Approaching, he thus spake: "What dost thou? &nbsp;Turn.<br>
Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself<br>
Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all<br>
Expos'd behold him." &nbsp;On his face was mine<br>
Already fix'd; his breast and forehead there<br>
Erecting, seem'd as in high scorn he held<br>
E'en hell. &nbsp;Between the sepulchres to him<br>
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,<br>
This warning added: "See thy words be clear!"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/10-109.jpg"><img alt="10-109b.jpg (42K)" src="images/10-109b.jpg" height="561" width="350"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>He, soon as there I stood at the tomb's foot,<br>
Ey'd me a space, then in disdainful mood<br>
Address'd me: "Say, what ancestors were thine?"<br>
<br>I, willing to obey him, straight reveal'd<br>
The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow<br>
Somewhat uplifting, cried: "Fiercely were they<br>
Adverse to me, my party, and the blood<br>
From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad<br>
Scatter'd them." &nbsp;"Though driv'n out, yet they each time<br>
From all parts," answer'd I, "return'd; an art<br>
Which yours have shown, they are not skill'd to learn."<br>
<br>Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,<br>
Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,<br>
Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais'd.<br>
It look'd around, as eager to explore<br>
If there were other with me; but perceiving<br>
That fond imagination quench'd, with tears<br>
Thus spake: "If thou through this blind prison go'st.<br>
Led by thy lofty genius and profound,<br>
Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?"<br>
<br>I straight replied: "Not of myself I come,<br>
By him, who there expects me, through this clime<br>
Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son<br>
Had in contempt." &nbsp;Already had his words<br>
And mode of punishment read me his name,<br>
Whence I so fully answer'd. &nbsp;He at once<br>
Exclaim'd, up starting, "How! said'st thou he HAD?<br>
No longer lives he? &nbsp;Strikes not on his eye<br>
The blessed daylight?" &nbsp;Then of some delay<br>
I made ere my reply aware, down fell<br>
Supine, not after forth appear'd he more.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom<br>
I yet was station'd, chang'd not count'nance stern,<br>
Nor mov'd the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.<br>
"And if," continuing the first discourse,<br>
"They in this art," he cried, "small skill have shown,<br>
That doth torment me more e'en than this bed.<br>
But not yet fifty times shall be relum'd<br>
Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,<br>
Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.<br>
So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,<br>
As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,<br>
Against my kin this people is so fell?"<br>
<br>"The slaughter and great havoc," I replied,<br>
"That colour'd Arbia's flood with crimson stain&mdash;<br>
To these impute, that in our hallow'd dome<br>
Such orisons ascend." &nbsp;Sighing he shook<br>
The head, then thus resum'd: "In that affray<br>
I stood not singly, nor without just cause<br>
Assuredly should with the rest have stirr'd;<br>
But singly there I stood, when by consent<br>
Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd,<br>
The one who openly forbad the deed."<br>
<br>"So may thy lineage find at last repose,"<br>
I thus adjur'd him, "as thou solve this knot,<br>
Which now involves my mind. &nbsp;If right I hear,<br>
Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time<br>
Leads with him, of the present uninform'd."<br>
<br>"We view, as one who hath an evil sight,"<br>
He answer'd, "plainly, objects far remote:<br>
So much of his large spendour yet imparts<br>
The' Almighty Ruler; but when they approach<br>
Or actually exist, our intellect<br>
Then wholly fails, nor of your human state<br>
Except what others bring us know we aught.<br>
Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all<br>
Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,<br>
When on futurity the portals close."<br>
<br>Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse<br>
Smitten, I added thus: "Now shalt thou say<br>
To him there fallen, that his offspring still<br>
Is to the living join'd; and bid him know,<br>
That if from answer silent I abstain'd,<br>
'Twas that my thought was occupied intent<br>
Upon that error, which thy help hath solv'd."<br>
<br>But now my master summoning me back<br>
I heard, and with more eager haste besought<br>
The spirit to inform me, who with him<br>
Partook his lot. &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br>
<br>"More than a thousand with me here are laid<br>
Within is Frederick, second of that name,<br>
And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest<br>
I speak not." &nbsp;He, this said, from sight withdrew.<br>
But I my steps towards the ancient bard<br>
Reverting, ruminated on the words<br>
Betokening me such ill. &nbsp;Onward he mov'd,<br>
And thus in going question'd: "Whence the' amaze<br>
That holds thy senses wrapt?" &nbsp;I satisfied<br>
The' inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight:<br>
"Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard<br>
To thee importing harm; and note thou this,"<br>
With his rais'd finger bidding me take heed,<br>
<br>"When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,<br>
Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life<br>
The future tenour will to thee unfold."<br>
<br>Forthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet:<br>
We left the wall, and tow'rds the middle space<br>
Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;<br>
Which e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="11"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XI</h2>
<br>

<p>UPON the utmost verge of a high bank,<br>
By craggy rocks environ'd round, we came,<br>
Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd:<br>
And here to shun the horrible excess<br>
Of fetid exhalation, upward cast<br>
From the profound abyss, behind the lid<br>
Of a great monument we stood retir'd,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/11-115.jpg"><img alt="11-115b.jpg (52K)" src="images/11-115b.jpg" height="541" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Whereon this scroll I mark'd: "I have in charge<br>
Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew<br>
From the right path.&mdash;Ere our descent behooves<br>
We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,<br>
To the dire breath accustom'd, afterward<br>
Regard it not." &nbsp;My master thus; to whom<br>
Answering I spake: "Some compensation find<br>
That the time past not wholly lost." &nbsp;He then:<br>
"Lo! how my thoughts e'en to thy wishes tend!<br>
My son! within these rocks," he thus began,<br>
"Are three close circles in gradation plac'd,<br>
As these which now thou leav'st. Each one is full<br>
Of spirits accurs'd; but that the sight alone<br>
Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how<br>
And for what cause in durance they abide.<br>
<br>"Of all malicious act abhorr'd in heaven,<br>
The end is injury; and all such end<br>
Either by force or fraud works other's woe<br>
But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,<br>
To God is more displeasing; and beneath<br>
The fraudulent are therefore doom'd to' endure<br>
Severer pang. &nbsp;The violent occupy<br>
All the first circle; and because to force<br>
Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds<br>
Hach within other sep'rate is it fram'd.<br>
To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man<br>
Force may be offer'd; to himself I say<br>
And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear<br>
At full. &nbsp;Death, violent death, and painful wounds<br>
Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes<br>
By devastation, pillage, and the flames,<br>
His substance. &nbsp;Slayers, and each one that smites<br>
In malice, plund'rers, and all robbers, hence<br>
The torment undergo of the first round<br>
In different herds. &nbsp;Man can do violence<br>
To himself and his own blessings: and for this<br>
He in the second round must aye deplore<br>
With unavailing penitence his crime,<br>
Whoe'er deprives himself of life and light,<br>
In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,<br>
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.<br>
To God may force be offer'd, in the heart<br>
Denying and blaspheming his high power,<br>
And nature with her kindly law contemning.<br>
And thence the inmost round marks with its seal<br>
Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak<br>
Contemptuously' of the Godhead in their hearts.<br>
<br>"Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,<br>
May be by man employ'd on one, whose trust<br>
He wins, or on another who withholds<br>
Strict confidence. &nbsp;Seems as the latter way<br>
Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.<br>
Whence in the second circle have their nest<br>
Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,<br>
Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce<br>
To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,<br>
With such vile scum as these. &nbsp;The other way<br>
Forgets both Nature's general love, and that<br>
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth<br>
To special faith. &nbsp;Whence in the lesser circle,<br>
Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,<br>
The traitor is eternally consum'd."<br>
<br>I thus: "Instructor, clearly thy discourse<br>
Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm<br>
And its inhabitants with skill exact.<br>
But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,<br>
Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,<br>
Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,<br>
Wherefore within the city fire-illum'd<br>
Are not these punish'd, if God's wrath be on them?<br>
And if it be not, wherefore in such guise<br>
Are they condemned?" &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br>
"Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,<br>
Not so accustom'd? or what other thoughts<br>
Possess it? &nbsp;Dwell not in thy memory<br>
The words, wherein thy ethic page describes<br>
Three dispositions adverse to Heav'n's will,<br>
Incont'nence, malice, and mad brutishness,<br>
And how incontinence the least offends<br>
God, and least guilt incurs? &nbsp;If well thou note<br>
This judgment, and remember who they are,<br>
Without these walls to vain repentance doom'd,<br>
Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac'd<br>
From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours<br>
Justice divine on them its vengeance down."<br>
<br>"O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,<br>
Thou so content'st me, when thou solv'st my doubt,<br>
That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.<br>
Yet somewhat turn thee back," I in these words<br>
Continu'd, "where thou saidst, that usury<br>
Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot<br>
Perplex'd unravel." &nbsp;He thus made reply:<br>
"Philosophy, to an attentive ear,<br>
Clearly points out, not in one part alone,<br>
How imitative nature takes her course<br>
From the celestial mind and from its art:<br>
And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,<br>
Not many leaves scann'd o'er, observing well<br>
Thou shalt discover, that your art on her<br>
Obsequious follows, as the learner treads<br>
In his instructor's step, so that your art<br>
Deserves the name of second in descent<br>
From God. &nbsp;These two, if thou recall to mind<br>
Creation's holy book, from the beginning<br>
Were the right source of life and excellence<br>
To human kind. &nbsp;But in another path<br>
The usurer walks; and Nature in herself<br>
And in her follower thus he sets at nought,<br>
Placing elsewhere his hope. &nbsp;But follow now<br>
My steps on forward journey bent; for now<br>
The Pisces play with undulating glance<br>
Along the' horizon, and the Wain lies all<br>
O'er the north-west; and onward there a space<br>
Is our steep passage down the rocky height."</p>

<h2>CANTO XII</h2>
<br>

<p>THE place where to descend the precipice<br>
We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge<br>
Such object lay, as every eye would shun.<br>
<br>As is that ruin, which Adice's stream<br>
On this side Trento struck, should'ring the wave,<br>
Or loos'd by earthquake or for lack of prop;<br>
For from the mountain's summit, whence it mov'd<br>
To the low level, so the headlong rock<br>
Is shiver'd, that some passage it might give<br>
To him who from above would pass; e'en such<br>
Into the chasm was that descent: and there<br>
At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch'd<br>
The infamy of Crete, detested brood<br>
Of the feign'd heifer: and at sight of us<br>
It gnaw'd itself, as one with rage distract.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/12-123.jpg"><img alt="12-123b.jpg (51K)" src="images/12-123b.jpg" height="560" width="357"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


To him my guide exclaim'd: "Perchance thou deem'st<br>
The King of Athens here, who, in the world<br>
Above, thy death contriv'd. &nbsp;Monster! avaunt!<br>
He comes not tutor'd by thy sister's art,<br>
But to behold your torments is he come."<br>
<br>Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring<br>
Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow<br>
Hath struck him, but unable to proceed<br>
Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge<br>
The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim'd:<br>
"Run to the passage! while he storms, 't is well<br>
That thou descend." &nbsp;Thus down our road we took<br>
Through those dilapidated crags, that oft<br>
Mov'd underneath my feet, to weight like theirs<br>
Unus'd. &nbsp;I pond'ring went, and thus he spake:<br>
<br>"Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep,<br>
Guarded by the brute violence, which I<br>
Have vanquish'd now. Know then, that when I erst<br>
Hither descended to the nether hell,<br>
This rock was not yet fallen. &nbsp;But past doubt<br>
(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,<br>
Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil<br>
Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds<br>
Such trembling seiz'd the deep concave and foul,<br>
I thought the universe was thrill'd with love,<br>
Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft<br>
Been into chaos turn'd: and in that point,<br>
Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down.<br>
But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood<br>
Approaches, in the which all those are steep'd,<br>
Who have by violence injur'd." &nbsp;O blind lust!<br>
O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on<br>
In the brief life, and in the eternal then<br>
Thus miserably o'erwhelm us. &nbsp;I beheld<br>
An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,<br>
As circling all the plain; for so my guide<br>
Had told. &nbsp;Between it and the rampart's base<br>
On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm'd,<br>
As to the chase they on the earth were wont.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/12-127.jpg"><img alt="12-127b.jpg (47K)" src="images/12-127b.jpg" height="405" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>At seeing us descend they each one stood;<br>
And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows<br>
And missile weapons chosen first; of whom<br>
One cried from far: "Say to what pain ye come<br>
Condemn'd, who down this steep have journied? &nbsp;Speak<br>
From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw."<br>
<br>To whom my guide: "Our answer shall be made<br>
To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come.<br>
Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash."<br>
<br>Then me he touch'd, and spake: "Nessus is this,<br>
Who for the fair Deianira died,<br>
And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.<br>
He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,<br>
Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs'd;<br>
That other Pholus, prone to wrath." &nbsp;Around<br>
The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts<br>
At whatsoever spirit dares emerge<br>
From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/12-129.jpg"><img alt="12-129b.jpg (48K)" src="images/12-129b.jpg" height="403" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,<br>
Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,<br>
And with the notch push'd back his shaggy beard<br>
To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view<br>
Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim'd:<br>
"Are ye aware, that he who comes behind<br>
Moves what he touches? &nbsp;The feet of the dead<br>
Are not so wont." &nbsp;My trusty guide, who now<br>
Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,<br>
Thus made reply: "He is indeed alive,<br>
And solitary so must needs by me<br>
Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc'd<br>
By strict necessity, not by delight.<br>
She left her joyful harpings in the sky,<br>
Who this new office to my care consign'd.<br>
He is no robber, no dark spirit I.<br>
But by that virtue, which empowers my step<br>
To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,<br>
One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,<br>
Who to the ford may lead us, and convey<br>
Across, him mounted on his back; for he<br>
Is not a spirit that may walk the air."<br>
<br>Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus<br>
To Nessus spake: "Return, and be their guide.<br>
And if ye chance to cross another troop,<br>
Command them keep aloof." &nbsp;Onward we mov'd,<br>
The faithful escort by our side, along<br>
The border of the crimson-seething flood,<br>
Whence from those steep'd within loud shrieks arose.<br>
<br>Some there I mark'd, as high as to their brow<br>
Immers'd, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:<br>
"These are the souls of tyrants, who were given<br>
To blood and rapine. &nbsp;Here they wail aloud<br>
Their merciless wrongs. &nbsp;Here Alexander dwells,<br>
And Dionysius fell, who many a year<br>
Of woe wrought for fair Sicily. &nbsp;That brow<br>
Whereon the hair so jetty clust'ring hangs,<br>
Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks<br>
Obizzo' of Este, in the world destroy'd<br>
By his foul step-son." &nbsp;To the bard rever'd<br>
I turned me round, and thus he spake; "Let him<br>
Be to thee now first leader, me but next<br>
To him in rank." &nbsp;Then farther on a space<br>
The Centaur paus'd, near some, who at the throat<br>
Were extant from the wave; and showing us<br>
A spirit by itself apart retir'd,<br>
Exclaim'd: "He in God's bosom smote the heart,<br>
Which yet is honour'd on the bank of Thames."<br>
<br>A race I next espied, who held the head,<br>
And even all the bust above the stream.<br>
'Midst these I many a face remember'd well.<br>
Thus shallow more and more the blood became,<br>
So that at last it but imbru'd the feet;<br>
And there our passage lay athwart the foss.<br>
<br>"As ever on this side the boiling wave<br>
Thou seest diminishing," the Centaur said,<br>
"So on the other, be thou well assur'd,<br>
It lower still and lower sinks its bed,<br>
Till in that part it reuniting join,<br>
Where 't is the lot of tyranny to mourn.<br>
There Heav'n's stern justice lays chastising hand<br>
On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,<br>
On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts<br>
Tears ever by the seething flood unlock'd<br>
From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,<br>
Pazzo the other nam'd, who fill'd the ways<br>
With violence and war." &nbsp;This said, he turn'd,<br>
And quitting us, alone repass'd the ford.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
